        <!--Information Content-->
        <content>
            <p>My whole life I have been physical active. From playing football as a kid to working as a personal
                trainer as
                an adult. The joy of being able to push your body pass its limits and accomplish a goal is what I have
                always lived for. Being active is something I have always been able to turn to when I need to dig deep
                and
                discover something new about myself. It has always been the tool that has allowed me focus and stay
                determined and accomplish anything I set my mind too. </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>Stepping into the coding scene is something I am excited about. Learning the tools necessary to build
                websites and mobile app is the greatest world skill to have in this generation. Itâ€™s so versatile and
                powerful as a software engineer, we control the trends and flow of how the world views the internet. I
                am
                always thinking of different ways to bring my background and life experiences into my coding process;
                blending the Intellical concepts of coding with my life experience I strive to provide a better user
                experience. </p>
